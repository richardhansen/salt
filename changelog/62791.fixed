Improvements to `salt.state.ldap` and `salt.modules.ldap3`:
  * The order of an attribute's values is now preserved when reading from and
    writing to the LDAP server.
  * The order of an attribute's values is now ignored when checking value
    equality, as required by RFC 4511.
  * Fixed attribute value encoding/decoding corner cases.
  * Fixed support for `bytes` attribute values that are not in a list.
  * Documentation improvements.
  * Miscellaneous code cleanups.
