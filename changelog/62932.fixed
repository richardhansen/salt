Improvements to YAML processing (`salt.utils.yaml`) that are expected to take
effect in Salt 3007 but can be previewed now by setting the option
`yaml_compatibility` to `3007`:
  * `salt.utils.yaml.dump()` will default to `salt.utils.yaml.OrderedDumper`
    instead of `yaml.Dumper`.
  * Dumping a YAML sequence with `salt.utils.yaml.IndentedSafeOrderedDumper`
    will be properly indented.
